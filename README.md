It's a 2D game with map procedural. 
Player has to find the exit from current level, ever taking carefull with his food. And avoiding or killing the zombies that can be or not at the level. 
The game don't have a end. 

# What is?
It's a recreation from a game on unity made how tutoria project in 2015.
I'm just take idea and assets to make this game. 
Some of codes probably looks like with the original projects because i'm watch all tutorial. 
But no one of them was a exactly a CTRL + C CTRL + V. All of them was what i remember from tutorial presented by Matt Schell - Screencaster (@mattmirrorfish). 

# Purpose
The purpose from this games it's just use how portfolio. 
I'm not have any intution to use how job or gain any money from this.
